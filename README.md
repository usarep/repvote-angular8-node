# USArep UI (Angular Universal) 

This USArep UI. As of this writing, it's in Angular 8. 

The Node server is in the backend/ directory. 

There are some things that are not included in the backend directory. 
One is a directory of photos of representatives -- which is generated by scripts that are also open source, and available to you. The photos also take up quite a bit of disk space.

A second group of files/folders that have not been included have to do with testing the site as an iFrame on a third party site.

The data for USArep is served by a Java server. The Node server is a thin layer that simply serves the Angular UI, and static images.
